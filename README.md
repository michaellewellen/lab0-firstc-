1. First complete the Worksheet for this Lab.
2. For this lab, you will be following along with [this short tutorial](#). It will introduce you to the very basics of C#.
3. You are encouraged to type the commands into the .NET window yourself. This will help you better understand what is going on.
4. After you have finished, accept the [GitHub Classroom Assignment for the Lab](#).
5. Open a terminal.
6. Navigate to your code directory (hint: `cd my-code-dir`).
7. Run `git clone {yourUrl}` to make a local copy of your repository.
8. Run `code {nameOfYourRepo}` to open that directory in VS Code.
9. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+\``, or the Terminal menu → New Terminal).
10. Run `dotnet new console` to create a new project in the current folder.
11. In VS Code, edit the generated `Program.cs` file by typing in the examples from the tutorial.
12. Use `dotnet run` to check that your code runs as expected.
13. Once you have completed the tutorial, commit your code to your local repo (`git add .` and `git commit -m 'finished lab 1'`).
14. Use `git push` to push the changes to GitHub.
15. Set up a time to review your lab with me to grade it.
