Programming

    First complete the Worksheet for this Lab.
    For this lab, you will be following along with this short tutorial (Links to an external site.). It will introduce you to the very basics of C#.
    You are encouraged to type the commands into the .NET window yourself. This will help you better understand what is going on.
    After you have finished, accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment for the Lab (Links to an external site.).
    Open a terminal.
    Navigate to your code directory (hint: cd my-code-dir).
    Run git clone {yourUrl} to make a local copy of your repository.
    Run code {nameOfYourRepo} to open that directory in VS Code.
    Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`, or the Terminal menu -> New Terminal).
    Run dotnet new console to create a new project in the current folder.
    In VS Code, edit the generated 'Program.cs' file by typing in the examples from the tutorial.
    Use dotnet run to check that your code runs as expected.
    Once you have completed the tutorial, commit your code to your local repo (git add . and git commit -m 'finished lab 1').
    Use git push to push the changes to GitHub.
    Set up a time to review your lab with me to grade it.
